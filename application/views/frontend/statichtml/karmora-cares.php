                            Karmora Shoppers can enroll their favorite Fundraising Organizations (schools, clubs, causes, charities, religious organizations, etc…) into the Karmora Cares Fundraising Program.   Once approved, the Fundraising Organization will be eligible to receive contributions we call “gifts” from all Karmora Shoppers.
